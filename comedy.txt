Ravi is panicking because the Wi-Fi is down and he has a "life-or-death" online meeting (it's actually a virtual date). Manoj, however, couldn't care less â€” he's happily reading a newspaper and sipping chai like it's 1995.

The two roommates argue over who should go to ask the landlady downstairs to reset the router. They play rock-paper-scissors. Manoj loses but pretends to faint. Ravi reluctantly goes down.

Mrs. D'Souza greets him sweetly... but insists he fix her TV remote and a broken ceiling fan before she gives the Wi-Fi password back (she changed it for "security").
